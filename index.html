                         A future in which we can feed 10 billion people worldwide and provide cleaner, more abundant drinking water while also protecting life-giving lands, lakes and rivers. 
                        A future in which natureâ€™s wild heart still beats strong through healthy wildlife and magnificent landscapes.This is the decade to take action for the planet. 
                        This must be the decade we save the planet.

                        if yearly emissions continue to increase rapidly, as they have since 2000, models project that by the end of this century, global temperature will be at least 5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the 1901-1960 average,
                         and possibly as much as 10.2 degrees warmer. If annual emissions increase more slowly and begin to decline significantly by 2050,  models project temperatures would still be at least 2.4 degrees warmer than the first half of the 20th century, and possibly up to 5.9 degrees warmer.

                         There are several factors that would help reduce the impact of our consumption habits.
                         Beneath are some of the practical ways that can be implemented in our daily life to reduce pollution.</p>
